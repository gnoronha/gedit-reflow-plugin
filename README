===================
Reflow gedit plugin
===================

This plugin allows to automatically format paragraphs using gedit margin width.
This is similar to emacs <alt>-q command that I love so much.


Install
-------

Copy the files reflow.gedit-plugin and reflow.py into your gedit plugin
directory (on ubuntu this is ~/.gnome2/gedit/plugins/), then restart gedit.


Usage
-----

After installation a new command 'Reflow' is available in the edit menu.  You
can also directly use <alt>-q.  Use this command anywhere in the document to
automatically format the current paragraph.
